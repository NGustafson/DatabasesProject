# DatabasesProject

Final project for Database Systems course Fall 2014

Intended to somewhat mimic school directory and course selection websites.  The database has since been taken off-line.  Not very pretty but it functioned properly.

Process:
- CSV documents containing necessary data created using Kimono Labs plug-in for chrome.
- MySQL database set up using DigitalOcean node.
- Data inserted from CSV documents using python scripts.
- JSP created for Java Web Application using Netbeans IDE.
